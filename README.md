1. As a site administrator, i want to be able to drag and drop site content (or parts of it) from one environment to another (i.e. i want to copy _this set of pages_ from stage to prod).
2. As s site editor, i want to visually compose pages via a convenient drag and drop user interface that allows me to drop modules/components and lets me see the page as it gets built.
3. As a site editor, i want to be able to access a tree structure that shows me how pages are (hierarchically) organised in the website. I want to be able to use this stree structure interface to re-organise content (move tree chunks around or copy them).
